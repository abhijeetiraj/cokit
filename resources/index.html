Exploring the computer design process is the main aim of this software.A
complex object such as a digital computer is an example of a system,which
may be defined informally as a collection of objects, called components,connected
to form a coherent entity with a well-defined function or purpose. The
function performed by the system is determined by those performed by its
components and the manner in which the components are intrconnected. Two
central properties of any system are its structure and behaviour.The structure
of a system is the abstract graph consisting of its block diagram with
no functional information.On the another hand,behavioural description enables
one to determine for any given input signal a to the system the corresponding
output <i>f</i>(a).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We now see the problem facing the computer designer(or any system designer).Given
a desired range of behavior and a set of available components,determine
a structure formed from these components that achieves the desired behavior
at an acceptable cost.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It can be very useful to divide a digital system into two parts,a data
processing unit and a control unit. For example,in the simple computer
model shown in figure,the CPU is the data prcessing part,while the memory
which contains the programs to be executed,is the control part. The CPU
is is neatly devided into an arithmatic logic unit(the data processing
part) and a program control unit (the control part).The components and
connections (data paths)traversed by the data constitute the data processing
unit and the rest of the machine is the control unit.The paths to be traversed
by by the data and the operations to be performed at each point of time
by the data processing unit are specified by the control unit.
<h2>
<font color="#FF6666"><font size=+1>Design levels</font></font></h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The design of a complex system such as a computer can be viewed on many
different levels, depending on the components recognized as primitive or
indivisible.At least three major levels can be identified in digital computer
design
<br>1.Gate level
<br>2.Register level
<br>3.Processor level

<p>Above figure shows some distinctions between the design levels.The type
of information processed increases in complexity as one progresses from
the gate to the processor level.At the gate level, individual or "random"
bits are processed.At the register level,informaton is organized into words
or vectors. Such words represent numbers,instructions,character strings,and
the like.At the processor level,the units of information are blocks of
words,e.g.,programs and data sets.
